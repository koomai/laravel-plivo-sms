# A Boilerplate repo for contributions

This package makes it easy to send notifications using [:service_name](link to service) with Laravel 5.3.

**Note:** Replace ```:channel_namespace``` ```:service_name``` ```:author_name``` ```:author_username``` ```:author_website``` ```:author_email``` ```:package_name``` ```:package_description``` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md), [composer.json](composer.json) and other files, then delete this line.
**Tip:** Use "Find in Path/Files" in your code editor to find these keywords within the package directory and replace all occurences with your specified term.

This is where your description should go. Add a little code example so build can understand real quick how the package can be used. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two.
